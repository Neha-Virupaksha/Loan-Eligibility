Loan Eligibility Prediction System
This project aims to automate the loan eligibility prediction process by implementing a decision tree classifier, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy in the loan approval workflow. The classifier was developed using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as pandas for data preprocessing, scikit-learn (sklearn) for data scaling and model implementation, and seaborn for data visualization.

Key Features:
Automated Loan Eligibility Prediction: Utilized a decision tree classifier to automate the prediction process, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of loan approvals.
Data Preprocessing: Employed pandas for comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality input data for the model.
Data Visualization: Used seaborn to create insightful visualizations, aiding in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
Model Evaluation: Ensured robustness and reliability of the prediction system by evaluating model performance using key metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world financial problems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for loan eligibility determination.
